# Configuration file for dnsmasq.
## Custom configuration for lightweight DCHPv6 service

# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same
# as the long options legal on the command line. See
# "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq" for details.

## CONFIGURATION RELATED TO THE SERVICE BEHAVIOUR


# Listen on this specific port instead of the standard DNS port
# (53). Setting this to zero completely disables DNS function,
# leaving only DHCP and/or TFTP.
port=0

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they
# tell dnsmasq to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot
# answer, and which load the servers (especially the root servers)
# unnecessarily. If you have a dial-on-demand link they also stop
# these requests from bringing up the link unnecessarily.

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
bogus-priv

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this.
no-resolv

# If you don't want dnsmasq to poll /etc/resolv.conf or other resolv
# files for changes and re-read them then uncomment this.
no-poll

# Or which to listen on by address (remember to include 127.0.0.1 if
# you use this.)
listen-address=::

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/hosts, uncomment the
# following line.
no-hosts

# Do router advertisements for all subnets where we're doing DHCPv6
# Unless overridden by ra-stateless, ra-names, et al, the router
# advertisements will have the M and O bits set, so that the clients
# get addresses and configuration from DHCPv6, and the A bit reset, so the
# clients don't use SLAAC addresses.
enable-ra

# Set the cachesize here.
cache-size=256

# Normally responses which come from /etc/hosts and the DHCP lease
# file have Time-To-Live set as zero, which conventionally means
# do not cache further. If you are happy to trade lower load on the
# server for potentially stale date, you can set a time-to-live (in
# seconds) here.
#local-ttl=


# Set the limit on DHCP leases, the default is 150
#dhcp-lease-max=150

# The DHCP server needs somewhere on disk to keep its lease database.
# This defaults to a sane location, but if you want to change it, use
# the line below.
#dhcp-leasefile=/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

# Set the DHCP server to authoritative mode. In this mode it will barge in
# and take over the lease for any client which broadcasts on the network,
# whether it has a record of the lease or not. This avoids long timeouts
# when a machine wakes up on a new network. DO NOT enable this if there's
# the slightest chance that you might end up accidentally configuring a DHCP
# server for your campus/company accidentally. The ISC server uses
# the same option, and this URL provides more information:
# http://www.isc.org/files/auth.html
dhcp-authoritative

# Set the DHCP server to enable DHCPv4 Rapid Commit Option per RFC 4039.
# In this mode it will respond to a DHCPDISCOVER message including a Rapid Commit
# option with a DHCPACK including a Rapid Commit option and fully committed address
# and configuration information. This must only be enabled if either the server is
# the only server for the subnet, or multiple servers are present and they each
# commit a binding for all clients.
#dhcp-rapid-commit


# Log lots of extra information about DHCP transactions.
log-dhcp

# If a DHCP client claims that its name is "wpad", ignore that.
# This fixes a security hole. see CERT Vulnerability VU#598349
