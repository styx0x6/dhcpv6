## Post-install configuration for dnsmasq
## Based on Debian version of /etc/default/dnsmasq

## This file has several functions:
## * to completely enable/disable starting dnsmasq,
## * to stop the resolvconf package from controlling dnsmasq's
##    idea of which upstream nameservers to use.
## For upgraders from very old versions, all the shell variables set
## here in previous versions are still honored by the init script
## so if you just keep your old version of this file nothing will break.

# Whether or not to run the dnsmasq daemon; set to 0 to disable.
ENABLED=1

# If the resolvconf package is installed, dnsmasq will use its output
# rather than the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to find upstream
# nameservers. Uncommenting this line inhibits this behaviour.
# Note that including a "resolv-file=<filename>" line in
# /etc/dnsmasq.conf is not enough to override resolvconf if it is
# installed: the line below must be uncommented.
IGNORE_RESOLVCONF=yes
